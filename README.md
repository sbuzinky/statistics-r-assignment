# Statistics R Final Assignment

The diamond industry is very competitive, with prices affected by various factors including physical characteristics of diamonds, market conditions and consumer demands. Understanding these factors and how they affect the business is crucial for optimizing pricing strategies and to remain competitive. This project aims to employ rigorous statistical methods to analyze a dataset containing various attributes of diamonds such as carat, cut, color, depth, clarity, table and price. By leveraging techniques such as descriptive statistics, regression analysis and visualisations, our goal is to identify the most significant predictors of diamond prices and provide actionable recommendations for optimizing pricing strategies.

Methods in R

Remove outliers from data using Interquartile Range (IQR) method

Scatter plots of numerical variables

Correlation analysis on numerical variables

Simple linear regression models

Evaluate predictors with p-value and R^2

Multiple linear regression models 

Evaluate predictors with p-value and R^2

Calculate Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to check for multicollinearity

Plot residuals with scatter plot and Normal Q-Q plot (qqnorm) 

Results

Our analysis confirms that carat weight is the dominant driver of diamond price: larger stones consistently command sizable premiums. Cut quality follows closely—Ideal and Premium grades achieve significant mark‑ups owing to their superior brilliance. Color (grades D–J) still differentiates value, though its influence lessens once carat and cut are accounted for. Depth and table percentages exhibit only minor, secondary effects. Overall, the refined regression model indicates that carat, cut, color, and clarity jointly account for the vast majority of price variation, validating their pivotal role in diamond valuation.
